The HTML and CSS project is a web design project that showcases the skills of a front-end web developer. It involves creating a webpage using HTML and CSS to create an interactive and visually appealing design. The project typically involves creating a layout, selecting fonts and colors, adding images and videos, and implementing interactive features such as buttons, forms, and menus.

Purpose and Skills:

The purpose of the project is to showcase my proficiency in HTML and CSS, as well as having the ability to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website. In the HTML section, we learned how to structure the content of the webpage using HTML tags such as <head>, <body>, <div>, and <p>. They will also learn how to add links, images, and videos to the page.

In the CSS section, I learned how to style the content of the webpage using CSS properties such as font size, color, background color, padding, margin, and border. We also had to learn how to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

Color Scheme:

The color scheme of the project can significantly affect the visual appeal of the webpage. A well-chosen color palette can evoke emotions, establish brand identity, and improve readability. For this project, I have chosen a modern and minimalist color scheme consisting of shades of Light brown, brown, and orange.

Primary background: #F5DBBB

Brown around the borders: 705D48

Orange to give it some pop: #f0a651
