        <h3>How CSS Animation Works</h3>

        <div>

         <p>In the early days of the internet, web pages were static and unchanging. They were simply blocks of text and images that were displayed on the screen. However, as technology has advanced, web designers have been able to create more dynamic and engaging websites through the use of CSS animation.

          CSS animation is a technique used in web design to add movement and visual interest to elements on a web page. It allows designers to create effects that were previously only possible with JavaScript or Flash animations. With CSS animation, designers can create animations that are lightweight, fast-loading, and can be viewed on all devices.
          
          
          
          CSS animation works by changing the properties of an element over a set period of time. This can include properties such as position, size, color, and opacity. To create an animation, a designer defines a set of keyframes that specify the changes to these properties at different points in time. The browser then animates the element between these keyframes.
          
          CSS animations can be triggered by different events, such as hovering over an element, scrolling down a page, or clicking a button. They can also be set to play automatically when the page loads. This allows designers to create a variety of effects, from subtle animations that add a touch of visual interest, to complex animations that tell a story and draw the user's attention.
          
          
          
          
          Animated buttons are a popular use of CSS animation. They can be used to highlight important calls to action, such as "Buy Now" or "Sign Up." In this example, the button changes color and size when hovered over, creating a sense of interactivity and engagement.
          
          <button class="button animated-button1">Buy Now</button>
          
          See the Pen Animated Button by Kevin Mullins (@kevinpmullins) on CodePen.
          
          Parallax Scrolling
          Parallax scrolling is a technique that creates an illusion of depth on a web page. It works by moving the background at a slower rate than the foreground, creating a sense of perspective. In this example, the mountains in the background move at a slower rate than the trees in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and movement.
          
          
          Animated icons can be used to add a touch of whimsy and playfulness to a website. They can also be used to convey information in a more engaging way than static icons. In this example, the airplane icon spins and changes color when hovered over, creating a sense of motion and interactivity.

          See the Pen Animated Icons by Michael Meltser (@meltser) on CodePen.
          
          CSS animation is a powerful tool for web designers, allowing them to add movement and visual interest to their designs. With CSS animation, designers can create effects that were previously only possible with JavaScript or Flash animations, and can do so in a lightweight and fast-loading way. Whether you're creating a simple hover effect or a complex parallax scrolling animation, CSS animation can help bring your website to life.
